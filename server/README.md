# Hotel Management API

A RESTful API built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **TypeScript** for managing hotel data. This API allows users to insert, update, and retrieve hotel information, as well as upload images for hotels and rooms. The data is stored in JSON files, and image uploads are handled using the **Multer** package.

### Key Change:
- Added a **/api** section in the `API Endpoints` section to explain that all the routes are prefixed with `/api`, so that users can easily identify where the routes are being accessed from.
  
This structure makes it clear to users where the routes are located .
